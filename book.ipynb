    "\n",
    "A **type rule** is an [inference rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rules_of_inference) that describes how a type system assigns a type to a syntactic construction. Inference rules take facts that have already been determined and build larger facts from them.\n",

    "The typing environment is written as ${\\displaystyle \\Gamma}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules are expressed using a horizontal line, with the required input judgements above the line and the resulting judgement below the line. As an example, the rule for creating a lambda term is:\n",

    "\n",
    "The sequents above the line are the premises that must be fulfilled for the rule to be applied, yielding the conclusion: the sequents below the line.\n",

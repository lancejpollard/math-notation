    "- $R$ and $S$ are relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this operation consists of all combinations of tuples in $R$ and $S$ that satisfy $θ$. The result of the $θ$-join is defined only if the headers of $S$ and $R$ are disjoint, that is, do not contain a common attribute.\n",

    "### $▷$ Antijoin\n",
    "\n",
    "The antijoin, written as $R ▷ S$ where $R$ and $S$ are relations, is similar to the semijoin, but the result of an antijoin is only those tuples in $R$ for which there is no tuple in $S$ that is equal on their common attribute names.\n",

    "\n",
    "The division is a binary operation that is written as $R ÷ S$. Division is not implemented directly in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result consists of the restrictions of tuples in R to the attribute names unique to R, i.e., in the header of R but not in the header of S, for which it holds that all their combinations with tuples in S are present in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally the semantics of the division is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R ÷ S = \\{ t[a_1,...,a_n] : t ∈ R ∧ ∀s ∈ S ( (t[a_1,...,a_n] ∪ s) ∈ R) \\}$$\n",

    "### Outer Join\n",
    "\n",
    "The joined table retains each row, even if no other matching row exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $⟕$ Left outer join\n",
    "\n",
    "The left outer join can be described in terms of the natural join (and hence using basic operators) as follows:\n",

    "$$(R \\bowtie S) \\cup ((R - \\pi_{r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n}(R \\bowtie S)) \\times \\{(\\omega, \\dots \\omega)\\})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "- $r_1, r_2, ..., r_n$ are the attributes of the relation $R$.\n",
    "- $\\{(ω, ..., ω)\\}$ is the singleton relation on the attributes that are unique to the relation $S (those that are not attributes of $R$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### $⟖$ Right outer join\n",
    "\n",
    "The right outer join behaves almost identically to the left outer join, but the roles of the tables are switched.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(R \\bowtie S) \\cup (\\{(\\omega, \\dots, \\omega)\\} \\times (S - \\pi_{s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n}(R \\bowtie S)))$$\n",
